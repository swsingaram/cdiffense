# CDiffense!

## Overview

Clostrdium Difficile (*C. Diff.*) is a highly contagious bacteria that thrives in an environment like the ICU ward.  Millions of ICU patients are infected with *C. Diff.* each year, increasing the risk of a flare-up if these patients are overlooked.  Patients diagnosed with *C. Diff.*  often undergo lengthy and uncomfortable treatments; and as a consequence, hospitalization costs increase by a factor of four on average.

CDiffense is a clinical decision support resource for clinicians to assess which ICU patients are at risk for a *C. Diff.* infection.  CDiffense offers on-the-spot assessment, so that clinicans can determine if the patient is at risk for *C. Diff.* upon admission.  To use CDiffense, please visit [www.cdiffense.xyz](www.cdiffense.xyz); a short presentation about CDiffense is [here](https://www.slideshare.net/SurendraWSingaram/c-diffense-179826520).  CDiffense was created by Surendra (Walter) Singaram as a Health Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science.  The project took three weeks to complete, from ideation to deployment.  I am grateful to Dr. Kang Liu and Dr. Robert Lowenstein, M.D., for our many fruitful discussions.
