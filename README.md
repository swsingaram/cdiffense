# CDiffense!

## Overview

Clostrdium Difficile (*C. Diff.*) is a highly contagious bacteria that thrives in an environment like the ICU ward.  Millions of ICU patients are infected with *C. Diff.* each year: if these patients are overlooked, the risk of a *C. Diff.* flare-up increases.  Patients diagnosed with *C. Diff.*  often undergo lengthy and uncomfortable treatments; as a consequence, hospitalization costs increase by a factor on average.  CDiffense is a clinical decision support resource for clinicians to assess which ICU patients are at risk for a *C. Diff.* infection.  To use CDiffense, please visit [www.cdiffense.xyz](www.cdiffense.xyz); a short presentation about CDiffense is [here](https://www.slideshare.net/SurendraWSingaram/c-diffense-179826520).

CDiffense was created by Surendra (Walter) Singaram as a Health Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science.  The project took three weeks to complete, from ideation to deployment.  I am grateful to Dr. Kang Liu and Dr. Robert Lowenstein, M.D., for our many fruitful discussions.
